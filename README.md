# Maze Game

A simple maze game where you try to navigate through a maze, or autosolve the maze to get to the goal.

I made this for my CSSE2002 assignment at the University of Queensland.

To play the game, run `Launcher.java`. You can also specify command-line arguments.
If one of the arguments is `GUI` then the maze will open in a GUI.
If another argument is given, that will be interpreted as the filename.
A maximum of two arguments should be given.
